Hey, this is the application I build which i believe could have a major impact on the internet after deployment. It's an interface
where users can list items they would like to rent out to people around them for a price. 

This application is in Java using SpringBoot framework and MVC architecture. This also features BCrypt and MySQL for database
configuration and manipulation.
