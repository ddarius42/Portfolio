Hey, this is an application I created where people get to sign in and connect with other motorist enthusiast around the world.

This app is in Python using the Flask framework. I chose the MVC architecture because I like the cleanliness and simplicity of 
the folder structure. It features BCryot for security, MySQL for database manipulation with CRUD operations. 
Thanks for looking around!
